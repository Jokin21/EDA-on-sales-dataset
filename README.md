# EDA-on-sales-datasetExploratory Data Analysis on Sales Dataset

Objective:
The objective of this project is to conduct an exploratory data analysis on a sales dataset in order to gain insights into sales trends and patterns, 
identify potential areas for improvement, and inform future business decisions.

Dataset:
The dataset contains rows and columns, with information on [profits,shipping mode,etc..]. The dataset spans [time period or date range, e.g. 2015-2016], 
and includes data from [sets,kurthas,etc..].

Methodology:
The EDA will involve several steps, including:

Data cleaning and preprocessing: This will involve identifying and handling missing values, outliers, and other data quality issues.
Descriptive statistics: This will involve calculating summary statistics, such as mean, median, and standard deviation, for key variables in the dataset.
Data visualization: This will involve creating various visualizations, such as bar charts, line graphs, and scatterplots, to explore relationships between 
variables and identify trends and patterns.
Hypothesis testing: This will involve testing various hypotheses, such as whether sales vary by product category or by day of the week,
using statistical tests such as t-tests or ANOVA.
Expected Outcomes:
The EDA is expected to provide insights into sales trends and patterns, such as:

Which products or categories are top sellers?
Are there seasonal or daily patterns in sales?
Are there differences in sales by customer demographics?
Are there any outliers or anomalies in the data that need further investigation?
These insights can then be used to inform future business decisions, such as:

Adjusting marketing strategies to target specific customer demographics or products
Modifying pricing or promotions to capitalize on seasonal or daily patterns in sales
Identifying potential areas for process improvement, such as improving supply chain efficiency or optimizing inventory levels.
Deliverables:
The deliverables for this project will include:

A report summarizing the findings of the EDA, including key insights and recommendations for future business decisions.
Visualizations, such as charts and graphs, to support the findings in the report.
Cleaned and preprocessed data that can be used for further analysis or modeling.
